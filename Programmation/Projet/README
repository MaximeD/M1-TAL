LANGUAGE FINDER v1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

This perl software will recognize the original language
of a source file given by the user.
At the moment, it is able to recognize the following languages:
czech  english    finnish  german  italian     spanish
dutch  esperanto  french   greek   portuguese  swedish

You can easily add a language by adding a corpus file
in the "corpus/" directory,
and the name of the language in the core program "language_finder.pl",
at line 44.

The program applies two different methods
based on words and suffixes comparison
(a standard one and a vectorial one).


HOW TO USE
----------------------------------------------------------------

This program is very easy to use !
Just start it.

If you want more advanced controls,
you can pass the following arguments:
-f <input text> : the name of the text you want to analyze
-l <integer>    : the number of occurences to process
-g <integer>    : the highest suffix length to process
-i              : reinitializes the corpus (debug)

THANKS
----------------------------------------------------------------

We would like to thank Ms. Bernhard for her precious advice
on how to program in perl, all well as the teaching staff
at Universit√© de Strasbourg.
We would also like to thank our families and friends,
especially Mihai Dumitriu,
for the moral support they showed us
during the development of the project.


INSTALL
----------------------------------------------------------------

On UNIX:
Unpack the archive in any folder with execution rights.
Make the program executable (chmod +x language_finder.pl)
Launch it (./language_finder.pl)

On Windows:
NOT SUPPORTED
(we did not test it under windows and we did not intended to try)
(in fact we don't care)

On Mac/OS:
Mac/OS IS Unix, just more expensive,
so it should work the same.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you find bugs, please contact us.

At the moment,
the program is unable to use more than one text of reference
per language.

The percentages given by the standard method heavily depends
on the number of languages.
The more languages there are,
the lower the percentages will be.
