=head1 NAME

B<concordancer>

Look for a word and prints the n character on it's side.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

@concordances = &concordancer($file,$word_to_look_for,$side_spread,I<"sort">)



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Give the subroutine the file to parse,
the word you are looking for,
and how many characters should be surrounding your text.

You can also give an optional argument: I<"sort">
which is either "left" or "right"

This optional argument will sort your results on their right or left context.

# the file you want to analyse
my $file = ("a.txt");

# which word are you looking for?
my $word_to_look_for = "activit√©";

# how many character on it's side?
my $side_spread = 20;

# do you want a sort ?
# "left" for left sort
# "right" for right sort
# nothing or any other string won't do anything

my @concordances = &concordancer($file,$word_to_look_for,$side_spread,"left");


# print the result, line by line
for (my $i = 0; $i < $#concordances; $i++) {
  print $concordances[$i]{left};
  print "\e[1;34m" ;            # color for a pretty output
  print $word_to_look_for;
  print "\e[0m";                # reset color
  print $concordances[$i]{right};
  print "\n";
}
